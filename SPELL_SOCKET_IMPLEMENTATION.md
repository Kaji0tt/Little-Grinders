# Spell Socket System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a spell socket system to the Little-Grinders talent tree, allowing players to equip pace-enhancing spells that improve combat flow and speed. The system replaces weapon ability XP bonuses with a more strategic socket-based approach.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Extended Spell Properties
- Added new SpellProperty flags for pace-enhancing clusters:
  - `PaceMovement`: Movement-focused pace enhancement
  - `PaceUtility`: Utility-focused pace enhancement  
  - `PaceAP`: Ability Power-focused pace enhancement
  - `PaceAD`: Attack Damage-focused pace enhancement

### 2. Socket System
- **SpellSocket.cs**: Individual socket component that can hold one spell
- **SpellSocketManager.cs**: Manages all sockets and provides spell selection UI
- **SpellSocketType enum**: Defines the four socket types (Movement, Utility, AP, AD)

### 3. Pace-Enhancing Spells

#### Movement Cluster
- **CombatRush**: Provides speed boost when combat starts
- **EvasionBoost**: Grants speed boost after taking damage

#### Utility Cluster  
- **VictoryMomentum**: Reduces cooldowns when enemies are defeated
- **BattleTrance**: Enhanced regeneration during combat

#### AP Cluster
- **ArcaneEcho**: Increases ability power based on recent ability usage
- **ManaFlow**: Provides mana management and ability cost reduction

#### AD Cluster
- **BloodFrenzy**: Increases attack speed with consecutive hits
- **PrecisionStrike**: Provides critical hit bonuses and combo multipliers

### 4. Talent Tree Integration
- Modified `TalentTreeManager.cs` to unlock sockets based on talent progression
- Socket unlock conditions:
  - AP sockets: 3+ points in AP talents
  - AD sockets: 3+ points in AD talents
  - Movement sockets: 2+ points in AS talents
  - Utility sockets: 2+ points in RE talents

### 5. Test Framework
- **SpellSocketTester.cs**: Comprehensive unit tests for socket functionality
- **SpellSocketIntegrationTest.cs**: Integration tests for the complete system

## Architecture

### Socket System Flow
1. Player progresses in talent tree
2. Socket unlock conditions are checked when spending talent points
3. Unlocked sockets appear in the talent tree UI
4. Players can click sockets to open spell selection UI
5. Compatible spells can be socketed for passive benefits
6. Socketed spells create ability instances that enhance combat pace

### Spell Categories and Effects

| Category | Focus | Example Effects |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Movement | Positioning & Speed | Speed boosts, dodge mechanics |
| Utility | Combat Support | Cooldown reduction, regeneration |
| AP | Spell Enhancement | Mana management, AP scaling |
| AD | Attack Enhancement | Attack speed, critical hits |

## Technical Details

### Key Classes
- `SpellSocket`: Individual socket component
- `SpellSocketManager`: Central management system
- `SpellSocketType`: Socket type enumeration
- All pace spells inherit from `Ability` base class

### Spell Integration
- Spells use the existing ability system framework
- Passive spells subscribe to game events for triggers
- Rarity scaling affects spell effectiveness
- Visual feedback through existing VFX system

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed**
- Spell property extensions
- Socket system architecture
- 8 pace-enhancing spells across 4 clusters
- Talent tree integration
- Comprehensive test framework

ðŸ”„ **Remaining Tasks**
- Socket UI integration (requires Unity scene setup)
- Unity testing and validation
- Weapon ability XP removal (no current evidence of implementation)

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers
1. Add `SpellSocketManager` to a scene GameObject
2. Create `SpellSocket` components on talent tree UI elements
3. Configure socket types and visual elements
4. Add pace spell `AbilityData` assets to the manager's available spells list
5. Test using provided test scripts

### For Players
1. Progress through talent tree to unlock sockets
2. Click unlocked sockets to open spell selection
3. Choose pace-enhancing spells that match your playstyle
4. Benefit from passive combat pace improvements
5. Experiment with different spell combinations

## Technical Notes

### Event System Integration
- Spells integrate with existing `GameEvents` system
- Combat events trigger pace-enhancing effects
- Damage events, attack events, and kill events are utilized

### Performance Considerations
- Passive spells use event-driven architecture to minimize Update() calls
- StatModifier system ensures efficient stat calculations
- Socket unlocking is checked only during talent point spending

### Extensibility
- Easy to add new spell types and socket types
- Modular design allows for different unlock conditions
- Spell effects can be easily tuned through rarity scaling

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Socket Upgrade System**: Allow sockets to be upgraded for more powerful effects
2. **Spell Combinations**: Create synergies between different socketed spells
3. **Dynamic Unlock Conditions**: More complex conditions for socket unlocking
4. **Spell Crafting**: Allow players to modify or combine spells
5. **Visual Polish**: Enhanced UI and visual effects for socket system

### Balancing Considerations
- Monitor pace spell effectiveness in gameplay
- Adjust rarity scaling based on player feedback
- Fine-tune socket unlock requirements
- Balance passive vs active spell benefits
