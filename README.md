# Little-Grinders


┌───── ### Game Concept ### 

Little Grinders is supposed to be an endless Arcade-Grinder with no Level-Cap. 
For this, everything in the game is set to scale by player and map level.               
The global Map consists of auto-generated map-tiles which increase in difficulty.                          
Aim of this project is, that the player may unlock close to infinite possiblities in weapons,
themes, talents and skill, aswell as variations in it.
Inspired by Diablo2, Titan Quest and Path of Exile, the goal of this project is, that nothing
but the curiosity and the complexity of its diversity in open end grind, thats supposed to 
motivate the player to explore the endless possibilities of creating his unique character and 
playstyle.

                              
                              Looten und Leveln!

┌───── ### Aesthetics ### 

- As an artist, the game design in terms of aesthetics and atmosphere is one of my utmost interests to improve.
- 2.5D Game-Design made of sprites of own drawings, to keep the game personal and relatable.
- Post Processing and Shaders to make it charming and give those drawings more live.
- Paper-Made Design in Sound and Sprite, to give it an sketchy arcade feeling, for the players fantasy to be involved.

┌───── ### Combat ### 
- Simple isometric combat system, moving with WASD, fighting with the mouse.
- The combat system still needs alot of improvement. Goal is to have an inuitive combat, thats as arcade as fluent, but diverse depending on chosen playstyle.

┌───── ### Online-Synchronised ###  
- While the game is meant to be a Singleplayer Game, Online-Profiles are thought of, to compare digital penises with other gamers.
- Thus, its also important for the player to have great possibilities in individualizing his or her character, to show of how unique the character actually is.
- Also, this includes the possibilitie for longterm mtx.
