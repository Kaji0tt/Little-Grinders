# Little-Grinders


┌───── ### Game Concept ### 

Little Grinders is supposed to be an endless Arcade-Grinder with no Level-Cap at all. 
For this, everything in the game is set to scale by player and map level.               
The global Map consists of auto-generated map-tiles which increase the level of mobs and
may contain objects that additionally increase player stats.                           
The character unlocks not only new modifiers for his items while leveling up, but also 
unlocks new map-themes and item-concepts. By this,this arcade grinder is supposed to be
driven by the players curiosity.                                                                    

                              
                              Looten und Leveln!
